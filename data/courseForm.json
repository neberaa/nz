Examples of freediving activities are traditional fishing techniques, competitive and non-competitive freediving, competitive and non-competitive spearfishing and freediving photography, synchronised swimming, underwater football, underwater rugby, underwater hockey, underwater target shooting and snorkeling.\n also a range of \"competitive apnea\" disciplines; in which competitors attempt to attain great depths, times, or distances on a single breath.used to refer to scuba diving, due to the freedom of movement compared with surface supplied diving.",
